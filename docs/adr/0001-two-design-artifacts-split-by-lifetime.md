# ADR-0001 — Two design artifacts, split by lifetime

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-08-12
**Related**: [XAS-027](../backlog/xas-027.md)

## Context

A repository using `xxthunder-dev-skills` needs somewhere for design to live.
The obvious candidates all already existed in some form and none of them worked
alone:

- Backlog items hold design, but they close. Anything written in one is gone as
  soon as the work is done, which is precisely when someone starts needing it.
- `superpowers:brainstorming` writes a per-story spec to
  `docs/superpowers/specs/`, which duplicates the backlog item that should have
  held that design in the first place.
- `AGENTS.md` paragraphs pasted per repo drift as their wording evolves and only
  protect repos someone remembered to edit.

The framing question — "should design live in the epic, the story, or a separate
document?" — turned out to have no answer because it mixes two different axes.
A.SPICE and the V-Model organise artifacts by **abstraction level**, describing
the product, so they live as long as the product. Scrum organises by
**increment of value**, describing a change to the product, so its artifacts
stop being maintained at Done: nothing is deleted, but nothing keeps them
current either, so they become history rather than reference. Sorting by
lifetime instead of by item size makes the question answerable.

## Decision

A repository using `xxthunder-dev-skills` keeps exactly two design artifacts
that stay **binding on the present** — that is, still true of the product as it is now, rather than a true
account of some past change:

- **An ADR log** at `docs/adr/` — why a structural choice was made. Frozen per
  decision and superseded rather than edited, yet each entry keeps binding
  until something supersedes it.
- **A living `architecture.md`** — what the structure currently is, with
  diagrams inline. Edited in place to stay true.

"Binding" is the property that matters, not persistence. Everything committed
persists; a closed backlog item and a finished plan sit in git forever. They
simply stop being true of anything once their change has landed, whereas these
two keep describing the product.

Everything else keeps its existing home. Design local to one change stays in the
backlog item's `Scope Decisions`. Decomposition stays in the epic. How the code
works stays in the code and its tests.

There is deliberately **no third place** for design to live.

The artifacts live in the consuming repository, never in the plugin directory.
`xxthunder-dev-skills` ships the skills that write and read them —
`design-record`, `architecture-scan` and a `SessionStart` hook — and owns none
of the content.

## Alternatives considered

- **Add per-epic design documents** (a third artifact, for epics too large to
  describe in the item). Rejected: applying the lifetime test, nearly every such
  document turns out to be either an ADR or an edit to `architecture.md`. Its
  real cost is that every future session must decide which of three places a
  piece of design belongs in, and that decision will not be made consistently.
- **One artifact only** — fold decision rationale into `architecture.md` as a
  Decisions section. Rejected: it loses immutability, and an edited rationale
  silently erases the reasoning it replaced. That erased history is the main
  thing the record exists to keep.
- **Lift requirements into a standing requirements document**, closest to a
  literal A.SPICE SWE.1. Rejected: it duplicates what a story's Summary and
  Acceptance Criteria already say, and staying truthful would require the
  bidirectional traceability machinery deliberately left out of scope.

## Consequences

- The backlog already builds half a V-Model: a story's Summary and Description
  are its requirement, and its Acceptance Criteria and UAT blocks in the same
  file are that requirement's verification mirror. Only the middle band —
  architecture and its rationale — was missing, and these two artifacts are it.
- ADR immutability follows from this choice: a changed mind is a new ADR that
  supersedes, never an edit to the reasoning it replaces. The precise set of
  permitted edits is stated once in `design-record`'s `adr-format.md` and not
  restated here, so that tightening or loosening it does not leave this ADR
  contradicting the rule it motivates.
- `superpowers:brainstorming`'s spec-writing step now conflicts with this
  structure by design. Resolving that conflict is what
  [ADR-0004](0004-always-on-rule-is-orientation-not-enforcement.md) addresses.
- Repos that install `xxthunder-dev-skills` but have no architecture yet
  documented start with an empty record, which is what
  [ADR-0005](0005-bootstrap-architecture-never-reconstruct-adrs.md) addresses.
- The rule is easy to state and therefore easy to follow: if it outlives the
  work, it does not go in the backlog item.
